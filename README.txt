This program implements a hashtable using the hash function implemented by David and the data structure implemented by Chris. Using the command 'make', an encoder file is created that can be fed an input text file. When the input text file is fed with the correct format, the string tokens are put into a hashtable that has a specified amount of slots. The contents and size of the first five slots are printed as well as the standard deviation of the hashtable.
